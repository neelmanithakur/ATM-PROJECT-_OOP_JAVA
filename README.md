# ATM-PROJECT-OOP_Core_JAVA
A console object oriented programming project on ATM machine.

Presentation Points:
A Account Holder goes to machine ,provide his credentials .
Account Manager checks the credentials and returns customers account to the machine(his name ,acc number, balance).
The account holder can withdraw , or check balance.


Missing Things in this project are :

Connecting this project to a Database, so that change in account balance can be stored.
No transfer money feature available, which can be done by adding database.
Missing mini statement facility to user.


Future commits:

Adding SQL Database to my projects.
Creating a central database which can handle transfer and user login .
Keeping track of recors made by user so that a mini statement can be given out.
Creating a full working ATM machine.
